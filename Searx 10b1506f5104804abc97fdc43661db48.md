**Website:** www.searx.github.io/searx

**How it works:**

Searx acts as an intermediary between the user and various search engines, sending queries to multiple engines simultaneously and retrieving the results: 

- The tool anonymizes the user's search queries, preventing search engines from tracking or profiling the user.
- Searx can be self-hosted, allowing users to control the data and customize the search engine to their needs.

**Usage scenarios:**

- Conducting private, anonymous searches without leaving a digital footprint.
- Aggregating search results from multiple engines to get a broader perspective.
- Investigating topics where privacy and anonymity are a priority.
